# Twitter-scraper
A twitter web scraping python script inspired by the drive for social justice with Machine learning.

The script prompts the user for login details, search keywords, search result section (Top / Latest tweets) and then scrap the tweets based on the search word and saves results in a csv file named by the user.

Info extracted include; username, handle, time, actual text, emoji, emoji titles, likes and retweets of tweets
It was also programmed to avoid scrapping sponsored tweets ads ensuring all tweet extracted strictly contains the search words.
